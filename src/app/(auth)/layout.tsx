//This interface AuthLayoutprops is being used to define the shape of props that the AuthLayout component can accept. Let's break it down:

//1.children: This is a special prop in React that represents any content that will be nested inside this component

//2.React.ReactNode: This is a TypeScript type that can represent any content that React can render (like text, elements, components, etc.)

//This is a core concept in Next.js and React where layouts act as wrappers that can contain different page content while maintaining a consistent structure.
